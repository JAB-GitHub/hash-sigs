This code attempts to be a usable implementation of the LMS Hash Based
Signature Scheme from draft-mcgrew-hash-sigs-15

This specific branch attempts to implement optional fault tolerance;
that is, no secret keying data is leaked on a miscompute.

This is in-process; a lot more needs to be done before this is ready.
