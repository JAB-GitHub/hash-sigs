This code attempts to be a usable implementation of the LMS Hash Based
Signature Scheme from draft-mcgrew-hash-sigs-15

This specific branch attempts to implement optional fault tolerance;
that is, no secret keying data is leaked on a miscompute.

This is in-process; I *think* it mostly works, but it still hasn't been tested
